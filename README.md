#### Swagger {host:port}/swagger
- You can try out the api from the swagger ui or use Postman
- The /Albums may take a bit longer to render in swagger UI in the browser.

- Get all albums with their photos {host:port}/albums

- Get single album with its photos {host:port}/albums/2

#### Remarks
- Write Integration tests for the Album Service. Time was against me, so i suspended this tests but integration tests and critical for quality api delivery
- Plenty of refactoring to do to clean the code
